# For each location, scautoloc performs checks to test if the depth estimate is
# reliable. If the same location quality (e.g. pick RMS) can be achieved while
# fixing the depth to the default depth, the latter is used. This is most often

# The locator might converge at a depth of 0 or even negative depths. This is
# usually not desired, as 0 km might be interpreted as indicative of e.g. a
# quarry blast or another explosive source. In the case of "too shallow"
# locations the minimum depth will be used.
# Note that the minimum depth can also be configured in scolv, possibly to a
# different value.

# this string is empty, then the amplitude is set to 0.5 * thresholdXXL, and 1

# If set to true, scautoloc will listen for manual origins. Manual picks and
# pick weights will be adopted from the manual origin and the processing
# continues with these. Origins produced this way by adding incoming automatic
# picks are nevertheless marked as automatic origins. But they may contain
# manual picks (even pP and S picks).
# Note that in order to listen to manual origins, make sure to add the LOCATION
# group to connection.subscriptions!
# This is an experimental feature relevant only for large regional and global
# networks, where interaction by the analyst is expected already before the
# event is over.
